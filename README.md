# Front End Web App with Plain JavaScript

> This \[repo\] shows how to build front-end web applications with plain
> JavaScript, not using any (third-party) framework or library. A
> front-end web application can be provided by any web server, but it is
> executed on the user's computer device (smartphone, tablet or
> notebook), and not on the remote web server. Typically, but not
> necessarily, a front-end web application is a single-user application,
> which is not shared with other users. -- Gerd Wagner
